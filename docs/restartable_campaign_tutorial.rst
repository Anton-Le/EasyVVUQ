Restarting a Campaign
=====================

This tutorial shows a simple case of saving and reloading a Campaign in EasyVVUQ. Restarting
a Campaign can be useful in a number of cases, such as when the execution phase takes so long
we can't (or don't want to) have our python workflow script running the whole time. This example
uses the same Gauss test case as in the `Basic Tutorial <basic_tutorial>`.

EasyVVUQ Script Overview
------------------------

The script can be found here: (:download:`easyvvuq_restart_campaign_tutorial.py <tutorial_files/easyvvuq_restart_campaign_tutorial.py>`)

To run the script execute the following command ::

    python3 easyvvuq_restart_campaign_tutorial.py
