Contribution Guidelines
===============

To contribute to the project you need to follow the contribution procedure which consists of:

   1. Fork the project code and clone it to your hard-drive
   2. Create a new branch that will contain your changes, switch to said branch.
   3. Make your changes while also committing constantly. Follow good commit message practices. We
      don't enforce any of the commit message styles but follow common sense. It should be possible
      to tell what changes were made and why from the commit message.
   4. Write tests for your code. We use pytest for testing. Look at examples. ANY non-trivial function should
      be tested. Especially for corner cases and invalid inputs. PRs will not be accepted unless the code is
      reasonably well tested.
   5. Document your code. At the very least you need to write docstrings in the NumPy `format <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html>`_. Code that is
      not fully documented will not be accepted.
