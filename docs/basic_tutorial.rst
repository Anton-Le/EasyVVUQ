Basic Tutorial
==============

This tutorial shows a simple EassyVVUQ workflow in action.
The example is slightly daft (it uses a program, `gauss.py` program which 
simply samples values from a Gaussian distribution),
but illustrates how EasyVVUQ samples from a parameter space, wraps an 
application and analyses output.
