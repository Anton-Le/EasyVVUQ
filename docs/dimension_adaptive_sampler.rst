Dimension-adaptive sparse grid tutorial
==============

This tutorial shows how to use a sparse Stochastic Collocation (SC) sampler
in EasyVVUQ. We will assume you are familiar with the basic building
blocks of an EasyVVUQ Campaign. If not, see the basic tutorial 
`here <https://github.com/UCL-CCS/EasyVVUQ/blob/dev/docs/basic_tutorial.rst>`_.

The complete code for this example can be found `here <https://github.com/UCL-CCS/EasyVVUQ/blob/wedeling-dimen_adapt_tutorial/tests/test_dimension_adaptive_SC.py>`__. This file 
demonstates the sparse grid using a analytic test function, for which we compute
exact reference statistics.
